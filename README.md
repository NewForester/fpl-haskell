<!-- fpl-haskell by NewForester:  notes and examples of Haskell -->

# FPL Haskell

This repository contains:

  * notes made while studying Haskell tutorial(s);
  * exercises and examples from the tutorial(s);
  * any other Haskell notes, exercises and examples of my own devising.

The study was done as part of an investigation into Functional Programming Languages with a view to answering the questions:

  * what is all the fuss about ?
  * do any offer any advantages over APL or Python for that matter

The notes and exercises are not a management investigation into why an organisation should use Haskell
but a technical investigation into what you would need to understand in order to begin programming in Haskell.

While the material here is my own, it owes a great deal to the tutorial(s).
