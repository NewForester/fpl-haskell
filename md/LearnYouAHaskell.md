# Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!

This tutorial comes highly recommended.

The tutorial is split into fourteen sections.
I expect the tutorial will have worked examples but no programming exercises.

It may be that reading one a day would be comfortable but note taking and working through the examples will make it a stretch
unless I am ruthless about keeping the notes short.

I intend to do the tutorial on-line at [Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!](http://learnyouahaskell.com)
